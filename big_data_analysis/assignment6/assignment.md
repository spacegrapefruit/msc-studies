## Assignment 6: Port Detection

Data set link: Any day from: http://web.ais.dk/aisdata/

The goal of the assignment is to detect marine transportation ports in the dataset. All sub-tasks shall be done in a parallel manner (python parallel, pyspark or etc.)

In the task, the students are free to choose their own reasonable and creative ways to define port parameters, but please avoid over-engineering. The most complex solution doesn't mean the best.

* [x] Filter out the noise and prepare data for port detection. (Think what is the noise in this solution. Not necessary as defined in task 2)
* [x] Create an algorithm for port detection.
* [x] Evaluate the relative size of the port.
* [x] Visualize ports. (Get creatively to it). Good to know the location of the port, the relative size of the port and etc.
* [ ] Presentation of the solution. The solution will be presented by the student. The presentation shall be max 5 slides, that will present solutions done in 1 to 4 tasks.
